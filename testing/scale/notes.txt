pip install locustio

Use the web ui to drive - set up the stacks using the partition key
set up, then verify the inserts done in the east show up in the
west.

locust -f simple.py

aws dynamodb scan --table-name PKTestTable --select "COUNT"
aws dynamodb scan --table-name PKTestTable --select "COUNT" --region us-west-2

error modes - function timeout before processing all the records ->
function gets called again with same set of records

25 locust users, did aboout 10,000 inserts

1st check in on east:

{
    "Count": 10107, 
    "ScannedCount": 10107, 
    "ConsumedCapacity": null
}

West was at:

{
    "Count": 5543, 
    "ScannedCount": 5543, 
    "ConsumedCapacity": null
}

The current approach is bottle necked - need to find a way to introduce some concurrency.
